# T32-Transit - MVP â€“ Work in progress

> ðŸ’¬ Ship something small fast - take feedback - rebuild - repeat

## Getting Started

#### Assumptions about your system

- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) is installed
- npm-package manager is installed

---

First, run the development server:

```bash
# run these commands in these order

# installs the required packages from listed in package.json (dependencies, and devDependencies)
npm i

# runs the development server (default PORT:3000)
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To see the things that I've learned so far, I've added that segment to a different file `learned.md`, adding things to it on an ongoing basis.

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deployement

Right now, it's setup to automatically deploy everything on vercel at [this link](https://t3-transit-app-nextjs.vercel.app/).

# Problem Statement

<small>PROBELM BEING SOLVED</small>

The default transit apps were hard to use ,the website bus schedule was hard to navigate. So I took that data and made a MVP of it.
Planned as per stages - build, test with people, feedback, repeat.

# Outcomes

- Scraped data and converted itâ€™s format
- created a quick design prototype using Figma

#### Ideal Outcomes

- learn whole flow from creating in localhost to deploying on the internet on custom domain
- the app is useful to at least me and few other people
- KEEP Improving the app - based on a secret plan that's my mind has still to come-up with.

- develop and execute against both short and long-term roadmaps
- make effective tradeoffs between business impact, user experience, and a high-quality technical foundation
