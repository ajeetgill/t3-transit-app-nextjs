# T32-Transit - MVP â€“ Work in progress

> ðŸ’¬ Ship something small fast - take feedback - rebuild - repeat

## Getting Started

#### Assumptions about your system

- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) is installed
- npm-package manager is installed

---

First, run the development server:

```bash
# run these commands in these order

# installs the required packages from listed in package.json (dependencies, and devDependencies)
npm i

# runs the development server (default PORT:3000)
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

# Problem Statement

<small>PROBELM BEING SOLVED</small>

The default transit apps were hard to use ,the website bus schedule was hard to navigate. So I took that data and made a MVP of it.
Planned as per stages - build, test with people, feedback, repeat.

# Outcomes

- Scraped data and converted itâ€™s format
- created a quick design prototype using Figma

#### Ideal Outcomes

- learn whole flow from creating in localhost to deploying on the internet on custom domain
- the app is useful to at least me and few other people
- KEEP Improving the app - based on a secret plan that's my mind has still to come-up with.

- develop and execute against both short and long-term roadmaps
- make effective tradeoffs between business impact, user experience, and a high-quality technical foundation

#### Requirements [Dropbox - JOB](https://jobs.dropbox.com/listing/4797603?gh_src=aonhf1)
